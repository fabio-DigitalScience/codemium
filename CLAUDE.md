## Project Overview

Codemium is a Go CLI tool that generates code statistics (LOC, comments, blanks, cyclomatic complexity) across all repositories in a Bitbucket Cloud workspace, GitHub organization, GitHub user account, or GitLab group.

## Build & Test

```bash
go build ./cmd/codemium        # Build
go test ./...                  # Run all tests
go test ./... -short           # Run tests (skip slow/integration)
go vet ./...                   # Static analysis
```

## Key Dependencies

- **scc** (`github.com/boyter/scc/v3`) - Code analysis (LOC, comments, complexity) for 200+ languages, used as a Go library
- **go-git** (`github.com/go-git/go-git/v5`) - Pure Go git client for shallow cloning
- **go-enry** (`github.com/go-enry/go-enry/v2`) - Vendor, generated, and binary file detection
- **go-license-detector** (`github.com/go-enry/go-license-detector/v4`) - SPDX license detection per directory
- **Cobra** (`github.com/spf13/cobra`) - CLI framework
- **Bubbletea/Bubbles/Lipgloss** - Terminal UI for progress display

## Architecture Notes

- **Provider abstraction**: `provider.Provider` interface allows adding new git hosting providers. Each provider implements `ListRepos(ctx, ListOpts)`.
- **Worker pool**: Bounded goroutine pool with semaphore pattern. Configurable concurrency via `--concurrency` flag.
- **Rate limiting**: `RateLimitTransport` in `provider/ratelimit.go` implements `http.RoundTripper` with token-bucket rate limiting and 429 retry (exponential backoff, `Retry-After` header). Injected via `--rate-limit` flag (default: 0 = unlimited, retry-only). All providers accept `*http.Client` to share the transport.
- **Partial failure**: Repos that fail to clone or analyze are recorded as errors in the report; the run continues.
- **Auth**: Credentials stored at `~/.config/codemium/credentials.json` (0600 perms). Resolution order: env vars (`CODEMIUM_<PROVIDER>_TOKEN`) → saved credentials → CLI fallback (`gh auth token` for GitHub, `glab config get token` for GitLab).
- **Clone strategy**: Shallow clone (depth 1, single branch, no tags) to temp dir, deleted after analysis.
- **scc initialization**: `processor.ProcessConstants()` called via `sync.Once` since scc requires global initialization.
- **AI estimation**: When `--ai-estimate` is used, a second pass fetches commit history via provider REST APIs. `provider.CommitLister` interface provides `ListCommits` and `CommitStats`. `aidetect.Detect` classifies commits, `aiestimate.Estimate` orchestrates per-repo. Results attach to existing report model as optional fields.
- **Health classification**: When `--health` is used, repos are classified as Active (<180d), Maintained (180-365d), or Abandoned (>365d) based on last commit date. Repos where commit history cannot be fetched (API errors, permissions) are classified as Failed with the error message stored in `RepoHealth.Error`. `--health-details` adds deep analysis: per-window author counts, code churn, bus factor, and velocity trend. Uses the same `CommitLister` interface.
- **Error logging**: API errors from health, health-details, AI estimation, and partial commit stat failures are collected and written to `<report>.error.log` (derived from the report path, e.g. `report.error.log` for `report.json`) when any errors occur. Each line is prefixed with a category for easy filtering. `AnalyzeDetails` and `aiestimate.Estimate` return `(result, []string, error)` where `[]string` contains partial error messages.
- **Vendor/generated filtering**: Always-on filtering using `go-enry` to skip vendor, generated, and binary files during analysis. `FilteredFiles` count is tracked per repo and in report totals.
- **License detection**: After analysis, `license.Detect` scans the cloned repo directory for SPDX license identifiers (e.g., "MIT", "Apache-2.0"). Results appear in the per-repo License column.
- **Code churn / hotspots**: Opt-in via `--churn` flag. Uses provider REST APIs to fetch per-file change data (`--churn-limit N` sets max commits, default 500). `churn.Analyze` collects per-file change frequencies; `churn.ComputeHotspots` ranks files by churn x complexity. Top 20 hotspots shown per repo.

## Conventions

- Pure Go, no CGO (`CGO_ENABLED=0`)
- All packages have corresponding `_test.go` files
- Test servers (httptest) used for provider and auth tests
- No external tools required at runtime (no git binary, no scc binary)
- After code changes, update relevant docs (README.md, this file) to reflect new behavior, flags, auth flows, etc. Specifically: new CLI flags go in README's "Additional flags" table and usage examples; new architecture decisions go in the "Architecture Notes" section of this file; new packages go in the "Project Structure" section of this file.

## Release

Releases are automated via goreleaser on version tags:

```bash
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

This triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` which builds binaries for Linux/macOS (amd64, arm64) and Windows (amd64).

Version info injected via ldflags: `main.version`, `main.commit`, `main.date`.
